Exercise 3:
(1 point) Comparing the outcomes of both sets of 100 runs, which seems to
be the "better" evaluation function. Judge on the basis of the quality of the solution
(incl. path) and efciency of problem solving measured by the number of expanded nodes.
State and explain in 1-2 sentences.

my answer:
i believe the better evaluation function is the first one. it responded more quicker
than the second evaluation function. the first evaluation had lower numbers aswell
which i belive makes it the one with better quality and speed.
