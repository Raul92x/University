Implement the building blocks of the 8-puzzle game for graphsearch.

1. Decide on a representation for the 8-puzzle state:

   Example:

      1 2 5
      7 B 6
      3 4 8

  This state could be represented as:

  (a) list of three lists puzz8 = [[1,2,5],[8,'B',6],[3,4,8]]  

      (workable but not necessarily the easiest representation to be working with)

  (b) as a dictionary with items (row,col):<tile no>

      puzz8 = {(1,1):1, (1,2):2, (1,3):5, (2,1):8, .....}

      (easier to handle than (a))

  (c) as a class Puzz8: .... with datamembers and member functions (nice, but possibly
      not worth the overhead


2. Ability to test whether a given puzzle state is a goal state.

3. A function that generates all possible (immediate) successor states to a given
   puzzle state.

4. An "evaluation function" that computes a numeric "goodness" score for a given
   puzzle state. Popular choice: "the number of tiles that are out of place relative to
   the goal state"

5. Useful: a function that will print out the puzzle state in a somewhat visually 
   appealing form.


If I had to do his, I would probably do this in the order of

1., 5., 2., 4., and 3. last.
