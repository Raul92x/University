i just started the assignment.
i copied the code from the link and made the example.js
after running the program i went to the url or ip address is gave me
it displayed hello world
i then made it say goodbye world and also worked
i changed the port number to 5000 and it didnt work the first time
that was because i forgot to change it 5000 in .listen()
after i changed that it worked.
